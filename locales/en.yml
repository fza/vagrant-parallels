      dhcp_leases_file_not_accessible: |-
        Parallels DHCP leases file is not accessible. The Parallels provider
        uses it to detect an IP address of virtual machine. This file must be
        readable for the user that is running Vagrant.

      mac_os_x_required: |-
        Parallels provider only works on OS X (or Mac OS X).
      prlctl_error: |-
        There was an error while executing `prlctl`, a CLI used by Vagrant
        for controlling Parallels Desktop. The command and stderr is shown below.

        Command: %{command}

        Stderr: %{stderr}
      parallels_install_incomplete: |-
        Parallels Desktop is complaining that the installation is incomplete.
        Try to reinstall Parallels Desktop or contact Parallels support.
      parallels_invalid_version: |-
        Vagrant has detected that you have a version of Parallels Desktop installed
        that is not supported. Please install or upgrade to one of the supported
        versions listed below to use Vagrant:

        %{supported_versions}
      parallels_no_room_for_high_level_network: |-
        There is no available slots on the Parallels Desktop VM for the configured
        high-level network interfaces. "private_network" and "public_network"
        network configurations consume a single network adapter slot on the
        Parallels Desktop VM. Parallels Desktop limits the number of slots to 8, and it
        appears that every slot is in use. Please lower the number of used
        network adapters.
      parallels_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant could not detect Parallels Desktop! Make sure it is properly installed.
        Vagrant uses the `prlctl` binary that ships with Parallels Desktop, and requires
        this to be available on the PATH. If Parallels Desktop is installed, please find
        the `prlctl` binary and add it to the PATH environmental variable.
      vm_name_exists: |-
        Parallels Desktop virtual machine with the name '%{name}' already exists.
        Please use another name or delete the machine with the existing
        name, and try again.

      status:
        inaccessible: |-
          The VM is inaccessible! This is a rare case which means that Parallels
          Desktop can't find your VM configuration. This usually happens when deleting
          the VM via Parallels Desktop GUI, moving to a new computer, etc.
          Please consult Vagrant Parallels provider for how to handle this issue.
        not_created: |-
          The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
          create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
          default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
          then the machine is not created for that environment.
        suspended: |-
          The VM is suspended. To resume this VM you can run `vagrant resume`
          or `vagrant up` to restart it again, so that vagrant would be able
          to control the VM again.
        stopped: |-
          The VM is stopped. To start the VM, simply run `vagrant up`
        running: |-
          The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
          shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
          suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
          simply run `vagrant up`.

            No Parallels Tools were detected on the base box for this VM! Parallels
            Tools are required for forwarded ports, shared folders, host only
            networking, and more. If SSH fails on this machine, please install
            the Parallels Tools and repackage the box to continue.

            This is not an error message; everything may continue to work properly,
            in which case you may ignore this message.
          version_mismatch: |-
            The Parallels Tools on this VM do not match the installed version of
            Parallels Desktop! In most cases this is fine, but in rare cases it can
            cause things such as shared folders to not work properly. If you see
            shared folder errors, please update the Parallels Tools within the
            virtual machine and reload your VM.
